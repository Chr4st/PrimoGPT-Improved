## Overview

PrimoGPT is a modular trading system developed as part of doctoral research titled "An Automated Stock Market Trading System Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning". The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to support investment decisions, aiming to minimize risk and potential losses through deep financial market analysis.

I am optimizing it further to the best of my abilities.
